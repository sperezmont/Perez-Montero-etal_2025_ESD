# Figures and code from Pérez-Montero et al. (2025, ESD)

This repository contains the code to generate all the figures of the Pérez-Montero et al. (2025) paper submitted to ESD. Here we show also an animation that represents the evolution of the modelled ice sheet during the last 800 kyr (AGING experiment):

This video represents the evolution of the ice sheet corresponding to the AGING experiment. It shows the elevation of the ice sheet, the sinking of the bedrock, the color of the ice and the variation in insolation.
